MultiThreading
==============
This project is a console application running on Java 1.7 and Junit 4.11 on Eclipse 4.3. It is a demonstration of two threads synchronously modifying values of an int array. All elements in the array initially are zero. Two threads modify each element by incrementing them by one at each access and in the end all elements are supposed to be two. There are various ways implemented in the project. Unit tests can be run to check the methods.
